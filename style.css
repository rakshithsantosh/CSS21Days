/* EM and REM

em is relative to the font size of the parent element
rem is relative to the font size of the root element

root element is the html element in some case root element can be declared by usinf :root 

never use em for font size instead use rem
but for padding and margin use em as its response 
and in this case it references the font size of the current element
